title: Containers
layout: main
category: cpp

The goal of this exercise is to appreciate the importance of
manipulating data structures that are contiguous in memory.

Take [`containers.cpp`]({{site.exercises_repo}}/hands-on/cpp/containers.cpp). It
implements for an `std::vector<int>` two operations:

* `fill()`, which fills the container with `N` integers randomly
generated. Each integer is inserted in a random position.

* `process()`, which applies a reduction operation to the
previously-filled container.

Inspect, build and run `containers.cpp`, also through `perf`, varying
the number of elements:

    [student@esc ~]$ cd esc/hands-on/cpp
    [student@esc cpp]$ g++ -O3 -o containers containers.cpp
    [student@esc cpp]$ ./containers 100000
    vector fill: 0.526868 s
    vector process: 2.9868e-05 s
    [student@esc cpp]$ perf stat -d ./containers

Then extend the program to implement `fill()` and `process()` for an
`std::list<int>`. Compare the performance obtained with the two
containers.
